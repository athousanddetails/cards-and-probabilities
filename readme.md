# Probability with Cards

The Idea behind this exercise is to study probabilities, combinations,
and match all this into python code. A simple yet intriguing exercise. 

We have a regular Deck of Cards with 52 Cards. 
Each Time we extract 5 cards from the deck. 

We want to know the probability of these hands:

* A - 4 Aces
* B - 4 Aces and a King
* C - Three 5 and 2 Jacks
* D - One 9, 10, Jacks, Queen and a King in any order
* E - Three of any suit and Two from another one
* F - At least one Ace
